  Volusion creates storefronts for businesses that want to sell their products online. I work as a Front End Developer, coding custom designs and premium templates within the Volusion platform. I work with a large team of designers and developers and contribute to refining workflow processes and creating a better end product.

<h2>Process</h2>
<p>
  Volusion has a quick turnaround with projects, which means its good to be fast. So a fast workflow always helps. For my projects, I use Sublime Text as my text editor, and CodeKit to compile my Sass and Compass.
