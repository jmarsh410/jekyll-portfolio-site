  Combining the collective talents of the photographers, videographers, designers, and developers of the Visual Communication school at Ohio University, Soul of Athens is a yearly publication chronicling the people and places of Athens, Ohio. I worked on this site for three consecutive years, contributing to information graphic design and development, and QA.
