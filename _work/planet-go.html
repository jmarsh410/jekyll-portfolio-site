<p>
  Planet GO! allows parents to search for local PBS events for their children. For this project I was brought in to revamp and complete an existing project. Together with a Project Coordinator, we wireframed and planned a completed vision for the product, which I then took and developed to be responsive.

  Originally, the site had not been coded to be responsive. Much of my process began with wireframing solutions to take the existing structure of the site and make it respond to its different breakpoints.
