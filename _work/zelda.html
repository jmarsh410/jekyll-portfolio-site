  Zelda is one of my favorite games from childhood. The atmosphere and the storytelling, especially in my favorite of the series, Ocarina of Time, are truly amazing. So, while I was learning Flash, I decided to make an interactive timeline that chronicles the history of this great game.

<h2>Process</h2>
<p>
  I created a few illustrations for oldschool game systems, and thought I could expand on that by making something about some of the games that went with those consoles. I began with some sketches, then started researching how I would create the interactions that I wanted to accomplish. Once I was confident that what I wanted to do could be performed, I started coding the project.
