  An infographic chronicling the incredible impact of social media and other networking sites during the political unrest in the Middle East, and how they were used in a much different capacity to what most are used to.

<h2>Process</h2>
<p>
  This project began with a lot of research. I found many examples of how social media was being used to coordinate protests, find family members, and raise global awareness. I decided to take a few key examples from some of the largest social media platforms and incorporate them with a map of the region for scope.
