  A while back, PBS Kids went through a complete overhaul of their website. The new responsive website absorbed the PBS Kids GO! site and was drastically different from the previous online experience. Their previous game graphics would no longer be appropriate for this new site, and so I was tasked with aiding in the creation of new game graphics.

  For this project, I would start by "researching" (aka playing) the games and aquiring what assets I could to use in the designs. From there I would sketch out some ideas for each one and translate that into Photoshop.
