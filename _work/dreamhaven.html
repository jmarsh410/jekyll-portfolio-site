<p>
  A Drupal website for a fictional Bed and Breakfast in Michigan. Website designed responsively for use on multiple devices. I took on the role of lead developer and troubleshooter for design and ux questions during the beginning phases. The key challenges for this product included finding the best ways to implement our ideas within Drupal and creating a product that would appeal to our target consumers.

<h2>Process</h2>
<p>
  Before any wireframes or designs were created, the team began by researching other bed and breakfast websites, noting what worked and what did not for each. This was followed by the creation of personas, userflows, and site maps. Once those were completed we began designing mockups, which were then used for development.
