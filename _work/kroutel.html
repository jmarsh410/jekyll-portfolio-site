  Ron is an artist and a Professor Emeritus from Ohio University in Athens, Ohio. He wanted a website that would display his expansive portfolio of work.

  After meeting with Ron, I had an idea of what he wanted from this website, and began to sketch ideas, after which I created mockups for his approval. After he was happy with the look and feel of everything, I coded out the website.
