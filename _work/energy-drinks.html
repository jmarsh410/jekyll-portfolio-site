<p>
  This is an informational graphic I created to represent the negative consequences that can come from binging on energy drinks. The idea evolved mostly from my desire to illustrate the human form, and the concept grew from there.
</p>

<h2>Process</h2>
<p>I started by brainstorming concepts for how I would like to illustrate the human body and the concept that it would revolve around. Once my topic was nailed down, I concentrated on the composition of the illustration in relation to the other information. Then, I created everything in Illustrator.</p>
