<p>
  This project is a redesign of the user flow for a to-do list app, named DropKick. The new flow reduces steps and better suits user goals.

<h2>Process</h2>
<p>
  The end product of this exercise was a rapid prototype, shown above. After analyzing many other apps of a similar nature, I began to realize how the process of this particular app could be refined, and so user flows were created to represent the new options. This was immediately proceeded by the prototype, which could be given to a test user that would "click" through the screens and give us their thoughts.
