<p>
  Ohio You! is a prototype app that a group and I created for Ohio University's University Communications and Marketing department. The finished product would allow students to learn about OU's campus life by making funny pictures of themselves around campus. I was involved with all aspects of the project, which included user testing, wireframing, and a lot of UX discussions. I was the Lead Developer on the project, primarily tasked with using xCode and PhoneGap to translate our vision to the iPhone.

<h2>Process</h2>
<p>
  Creating usable apps requires a lot of forethought. The team started with userflows, personas, and a competitive analysis of similar apps on the app store. From there we adopted an agile work environment, simultaneously working on design and code and constantly changing aspects of the project to make the app more usable.
