<h2>Process</h2>
<p>
  Before creating this site, I created a proposal document that included objectives, personas, site maps, userflows, a style guide (with colors and font choices), and a comparitive analysis of similar websites. After that, I wireframed every page, made a mockup, and coded it out.
