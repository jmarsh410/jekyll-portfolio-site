  A few years back I had the opportunity to intern for PBS Kids in Washington DC. The internship was one of the most outstanding experiences of my life. I had loads of fun and learned a great deal. My responsibilities included the design of game graphics, promotional graphics for kids programs, play testing games, and development of web pages. My largest project was developing a new PBS Kids GO! Games page. The current page was just a big long list of games, and the team wanted to improve the experience for the kids. I researched popular game pages throughout the internet, pitched my ideas for layout and functionality, and started developing after receiving a mockup that the lead designer created. Edit: Since my time at PBS, they have gone through a redesign, making everything responsive and absorbing the PBS Kids GO! brand back into the PBS Kids brand.

  I established a long lasting love of sketching from PBS. Bigger paper meant bigger ideas, and I was often surrounded by huge pieces of paper with doodles and notes. When I needed to create a web page, or design a graphic, I would start on paper, move to digital wireframes, then mockups, get approval/feedback from my supervisors, and then create the final product.
